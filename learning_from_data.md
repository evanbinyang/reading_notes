# The learning problem

Learning from data is used in situations where we don't have an analytic solution, but we do have data that we can use to construct an empirical solution.

There is the input $\bold x$, the unknown target function $f: \mathcal{X}\to\mathcal{Y}$, where $\mathcal{X}$ is the input space and $\mathcal{Y}$ is the output space. There is a data set $\mathcal{D}$ of input-output examples $(x_1, y_1), ..., (x_N, y_N)$ where $y_n=f(x_n)$ for $n=1,...,N$. Finally, there is the learning algorithm that uses the data set $\mathcal{D}$ to pick a formula $g:  \mathcal{X}\to\mathcal{Y}$ that approximates $f$. The algorithm chooses $g$ from a set of candidate formulas under consideration, which we call the hypothesis set $ \mathcal{H}$. The hypothesis set and learning algorithm are referred to informally as the learning model.
